[ introduction ]

I am an engineer implementing software for PCIE based data acquisition
devices. The devices are designed and implemented in VHDL on XILINX FPGA
by other people working in the same group. I wanted a simple way to test
the drivers I am implementing against their VHDL design. The problem is
that setting up a real hardware device takes a lot of time (FPGA synthesis,
flashing large memories ...). Thus, I ended up with developing a virtual
environment consisting of QEMU, LINUX and GHDL glued alltogether by a
small TCP based protocol. It allows PCIE devices to be implemented as
standard userland processes, answering actual PCIE requests coming from
QEMU. It supports PCIE configuration headers, requests, memory readwrite
operations and MSI. Different abstractions are provided to simplify the
implementation of PCIE devices.

[[ QEMU ]]

Instructions to clone the QEMU repo are available at:
http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page

checkout revision:
58617a795c8067b2f9800cffce60f38707d3aa31

Apply the patch:
qemu/qemu_58617a795c8067b2f9800cffce60f38707d3aa31.diff

It adds PCIEFW to the QEMU hw directory and integrate it to the build system

[[ GHDL ]]

Currently, GHDL has to be compiled from sources. A working repository is at:

[ implementing PCIE devices ]

Devices are implemented in userland processes. They communicate with
QEMU using TCP sockets. Currently, only a point to point connection
is possible, but this is to change in a future version. Basically, QEMU
forwards PCIE requests to the device userland process using the PCIEFW
and the corresponding small protocol. The protocol is minimalist and
may lack features (esp. identifiers). Improvements will be made as
needed. Currently, userland process have been implemented in C or VHDL
using the GHDL frontend.

A small PCIE runtime is provided for both C and VHDL. It consists of
several layers:
. callback based network messaging (pcie_net.c),
. PCIE low level requests (pcie.c),
. simple glue and packages for GHDL (pcie_xxx.vhdl).

These layers are made to simplify the development of simple PCIE devices,
so that one can focus on the hardware logic. They have some limitations,
but one can still choose not to use them and directly handle low level
PCIE and protocol details. Note that they are not


[ random thoughts ]

Not implemented with performance in mind, but it works quite well enough
for functional testing purposes. If performances become an issue, a shared
memory could be favored over the current TCP based transport layer if QEMU
and the virtual device are located on the same physical machine.

The VHDL pcie physical layer should be nearer than the XILINX one. Ideally,
it should implement the same interface.
